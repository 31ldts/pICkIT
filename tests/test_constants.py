"""Tests for pickit.constants.

These are new tests introduced during Fase 2, step 1 (extraction of
constants.py). They didn't exist as a dedicated Fase 0 baseline test file
because the constants had no dedicated public API before — they were just
module globals inside analyze_interactions.py, already exercised indirectly
by the baseline suite. These smoke tests lock down the extracted module's
shape so a future edit can't silently drop or rename a constant that other
modules depend on.
